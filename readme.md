Pseudocode:
1. Take input from prompt that will be rock, paper or scissors
2. Call getComputerChoice function to return rounded off value of Math.Random*10
3. If returned value for getComputerChoice is from 1 to 3 -- rock
                                                   4 to 6 -- paper
                                                   7 to 9 -- scissors
                                                   anything else(0 or 10) --  skip
4. Compare the returned value with inputted value accordingly print who won
5. If value is same, again prompt them to enter value again and rerun the conditional(Make conditional as recursive function, Iggg +_+)
